## High-School Project in cybersecurity (Phishing website clone)
>> Supervising Professor: Cristoph Vogel
## Project
>Our goal was to recreate the main login page of Microsoft and then save the entered values to a text file through PHP. The user was then rerouted to a given link.
In this project, we received permission from the head professor, and we had the website live for a test run where subjects had accepted participation. After comparing the results, the individuals could not discern the real landing page from ours, except for the URL.

> Because the website was almost indiccernable, the local swiss network provider Swisscom redflagged it 3 minutes after putting it live. The htaccess and htpassword files are there to only allow people with credentials to access on the page and to prevent network bots from flagging it.
